This app will allow you to understand more about Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence as you pit strategies against one another to see the strengths and weaknesses of each in a variety of game settings. Play with common strategies such as Tit-for-Tat, Fictitious Play, or the Godfather as you interact in common games, such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken, and Battle of the Sexes.

Have an algorithm that you'd like to add? Feel free to contribute to our open source GitHub repository! Pull requests are welcome! Here's how to start:

If you'd like to add a new Game or Player, just create a new class that extends the base object, specifying the required fields. You should then be able to load up the app yourself and test to make sure that your game or player is handled properly.
